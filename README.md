Day 1:
This is just a start to how to start android development and get into it. There is not much to do at the first day because all you end up doing is researching, talking to people and getting yourself ready with the software and other requirements. Here is the very first blog on my experience of the very first day starting with android development.

Day 2:
This can be stated as the first actual step in learning android because today I literally starting using android studio software in making my own application. It was all basic basic things done today like designing the app window with images and button, aligning the elements and finally running the app on the virtual phone.
