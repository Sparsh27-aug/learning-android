Day 1:
This is just a start to how to start android development and get into it. There is not much to do at the first day because all you end up doing is researching, talking to people and getting yourself ready with the software and other requirements. Here is the very first blog on my experience of the very first day starting with android development.

Day 2:
This can be stated as the first actual step in learning android because today I literally starting using android studio software in making my own application. It was all basic basic things done today like designing the app window with images and button, aligning the elements and finally running the app on the virtual phone.

Day 3:
So we are finally done with making a very very basic app which even has a little processing. I even learned how to share that to others but yaa thats not safe and secured.This was really nice to make an app although it was nothing just a simple thing but it kicks you to learn more and proceed further.

Day 4:
After making a very basic app in the past three day, the fourth day is all about learning more tools and features of the android studio. Today we have not started making some other application rather we have focussed more on learning the layouts that makes our work easy and takes less time!
